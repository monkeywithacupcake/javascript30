This repo is my trip through [Wes Bos javascript30](https://javascript30.com/). I'm starting on 22Feb2018.

## Day 7
A little bit of array methods review. And...some cleaner code with fewer temporary variables. I like it.

## Day 6
Search and highlight matches from data. This was a simple data fetching and then quick updates to a page. I learned more ways to use regex and how to match while things are still going (listen for `keyup` instead of just `change`). I should have realized the match before because we used `keyup` for the drumkit on day 1. I also liked the css for this day even though we did not touch it at all. The accordion effect is simpler than I thought.

## Day 5
Fancy page animations with css flexbox and a little bit of javascript to change css classes. I knew the basics of flexbox, but I followed along completely to update my css and js file. I am enjoying learning about the transitions and transforms.

## Day 4
Data wrangling with array functions. Yay. I already knew most of these. My use of other languages instead of javascript for most of these functions made me screw up a little bit at first, but I was able to figure it out mostly. Learned some pretty tricks for reduce, though.

## Day 3
Updates css variables based on user input and applies them to elements on the page. I copied the starter code into my index.html and style.css, created a new js file, and updated the css and wrote the js while watching the video. I had no idea about css variables, so the whole thing was new to me. The actual setup of this file is testy to the screen it is rendered on, so it did not work for me when I was looking at my javascript console, but I did not update it. I'm excited to learn about css variables.

## Day 2
Takes in the current time from js and updates the css clock image. I copied the starter code into my index.html and style.css, created a new js file, and updated the css and wrote the js while watching the video. I greatly prefer my files split up, but I understand why they are all on one page for these simple projects.  After he walked us through the seconds, I paused the video and wrote the minutes and hours alone and changed my `transition-timing-function` to `ease-in-out;` instead of the curve bezier, which seemed too jumpy on my screen. I was happy that it worked.

## Day 1
A simple (but awesome) keyboard based drumkit. I copied the starter code into my index.html and wrote the main.js script while watching the video. I did not know how to handle changing classes with vanilla javascript before - always used jquery! **I love that I can just navigate into the project directory and use `python3 -m http.server ` to serve the files locally.**
