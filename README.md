# javascript30
This repo is my trip through [Wes Bos javascript30](https://javascript30.com/). I'm starting on 22Feb2018.

## Day 2
Takes in the current time from js and updates the css clock image. I copied the starter code into my index.html and style.css, created a new js file, and updated the css and wrote the js while watching the video. I greatly prefer my files split up, but I understand why they are all on one page for these simple projects.  After he walked us through the seconds, I paused the video and wrote the minutes and hours alone and changed my `transition-timing-function` to `ease-in-out;` instead of the curve bezier, which seemed too jumpy on my screen. I was happy that it worked. 

## Day 1
A simple (but awesome) keyboard based drumkit. I copied the starter code into my index.html and wrote the main.js script while watching the video. I did not know how to handle changing classes with vanilla javascript before - always used jquery! **I love that I can just navigate into the project directory and use `python3 -m http.server ` to serve the files locally.**
