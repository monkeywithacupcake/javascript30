# javascript30
This repo is my trip through [Wes Bos javascript30](https://javascript30.com/). I'm starting on 22Feb2018.

## Day 1
I copied the starter code into my index.html and wrote the main.js script while watching the video. I did not know how to handle changing classes with vanilla javascript before - always used jquery!
